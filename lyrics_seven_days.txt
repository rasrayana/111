Weight of the world on your shoulders
I'll kiss your waist and ease your mind
I must be favored to know ya
I'll take my hands and trace your lines
It's the way that you can ride
It's the way that you can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week
You love when I jump right in
All of me, I'm offering
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
Wind it back, I'll take it slow
Leave you with that afterglow
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
It's the way that you can ride
It's the way that you can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, oh-oh-oh-oh
